# SocialMedia
Web application built using ReactJS for Social Media.  This application allows a user to register, login, create a profile, and add or edit their friend's list.  It also enables users to create events and to display the location of those events on a Google Map.  

All forms were implemented using Formik, and the events page contains a modal built using Formik and Loki.
